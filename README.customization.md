  ```sh
  ./scripts/rename-template.sh <your-new-project-name>
  ```

## 2. Update Metadata

- Change author, description, and repository fields in `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`.
- Update badges in `README.md`.

## 3. Review Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values as needed.

## 4. Update CI/CD

- Edit workflow files in `.github/workflows/` to match your project and org.

## 5. Review Security & Contribution Policies
