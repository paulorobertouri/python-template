# Python Template

This project showcases examples of unit testing in Python using the `unittest` and `pytest` frameworks. Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development that helps ensure the quality and reliability of your code by validating its behavior against expected outcomes.

This project can be used as a template for new Python projects, providing a structured layout and examples of unit tests for different scenarios and functionalities. By exploring the examples and best practices in this project, you can learn how to write effective unit tests and improve the quality of your codebase.

## How to Run the Tests

To run the unit tests in this project, you can use either the `unittest` framework or the `pytest` framework. Both frameworks provide powerful tools for writing and executing tests, allowing you to validate the correctness of your code and ensure its reliability.

### Running Tests with CLI

To run the tests using the command-line interface (CLI), follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

3. Run the tests using the `pytest` command:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

### Running Tests with IDE (VS Code):

If you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your development environment, you can run the tests directly from the editor. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.

2. Install the recommended extensions for Python (if not already installed).

3. Open the Test Explorer sidebar by clicking on the "Test" icon in the Activity Bar.

4. Click on the "Run All Tests" button to execute all the tests in the project.

By following these steps, you can run the unit tests using either the CLI or the IDE, making it easy to validate the correctness of your code and ensure its reliability.

## Test Coverage

Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development that helps ensure the quality and reliability of your code. By writing tests that cover different scenarios and functionalities, you can identify potential issues early in the development process and prevent bugs from reaching production.

In this project, we have included a variety of unit tests that cover various aspects of the codebase. These tests are designed to validate the behavior of individual units of code, such as functions, classes, and modules, to ensure that they work as expected.

By running the tests and analyzing the test coverage, you can gain insights into the effectiveness of your tests and identify areas that may require additional testing. Test coverage metrics, such as line coverage, branch coverage, and statement coverage, provide valuable information about the quality of your tests and help you improve the overall test suite.

To measure the test coverage of your code, you can use tools like `coverage.py` in combination with `pytest-cov` to generate coverage reports. These reports show the percentage of code that is covered by your tests, allowing you to assess the thoroughness of your test suite and make informed decisions about where to focus your testing efforts.

By striving for high test coverage and writing comprehensive unit tests, you can increase the reliability and maintainability of your code, leading to a more robust and bug-free software application.

### Running Tests with Coverage

To run the tests with coverage measurement, you can use the following command:

```bash
make test
```

Or using scripts (Ubuntu):

```bash
./scripts/ubuntu/test.sh
```

Or using scripts (Windows):

```bash
./scripts/windows/test.ps1
```

Or manually:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov --cov-report=html --cov-report=term --cov-report=term-missing
```

This command will run the tests and generate a coverage report in both HTML and terminal formats. You can view the coverage report by opening the `htmlcov/index.html` file in your web browser or checking the terminal output for detailed coverage information.

By analyzing the coverage report, you can gain insights into the effectiveness of your tests and identify areas that may require additional testing. Aim to achieve high test coverage to ensure the reliability and quality of your codebase.

## Sections

This project is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of unit testing using `unittest` and `pytest`. By exploring these sections, you can learn valuable techniques and best practices for writing effective unit tests in Python.

### Section 1: `test_demo_data.py`

This section contains examples of unit tests written using the `unittest` framework. The tests cover various scenarios and functionalities of the `demo_data.py` module, which provides functions for generating and processing demo data.

### Section 2: `test_demo_data_mock.py`, `test_demo_data_mock_func.py`, `test_demo_data_mock_with.py` and

This section demonstrates how to mock functions and methods using the `unittest.mock` module. By mocking functions and methods, you can simulate their behavior and return values, allowing you to test different scenarios and edge cases effectively.

### Section 3: `test_demo_data_class.py`

This section showcases examples of unit tests for classes written using the `unittest` framework. The tests cover different aspects of the `DemoData` class, including initialization, methods, and properties, to validate its behavior and ensure its correctness.

### Section 4: `test_demo_data_pytest.py`

This section introduces the `pytest` framework and demonstrates how to write unit tests using `pytest`. `pytest` provides a simple and powerful way to write tests with less boilerplate code, making it easier to create comprehensive test suites and validate the behavior of your code.

### Section 5: `test_demo_data_service.py`

This section contains examples of unit tests for a service class that interacts with external dependencies, such as databases and APIs. The tests use mocking and dependency injection techniques to isolate the service class and validate its behavior independently of external services.

### Section 6: `test_str_helpers.py`, `test_version_data.py`, `test_version_utils.py`

This section contains real-world examples of unit tests for utility functions and modules. The tests cover different functionalities and edge cases, allowing you to gain practical experience in writing effective unit tests for your codebase.

## Best Practices

When writing a code with Python, it is possible to use the `flake8`, `mypy`, `pyright`, `black`, and `isort` tools to enforce code quality and consistency in your project. These tools help identify potential issues, enforce coding standards, and format your code according to best practices.

To run these tools, you can use the following commands:

```bash
make check
```

Or using scripts (Ubuntu):

```bash
./scripts/ubuntu/check.sh
```

Or using scripts (Windows):

```bash
./scripts/windows/check.ps1
```

Or manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

By running these tools, you can ensure that your code adheres to best practices, follows coding standards, and maintains a high level of quality and consistency. This helps improve the readability, maintainability, and reliability of your codebase, making it easier to collaborate with other developers and maintain the project over time.

## Conclusion

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that helps ensure the correctness and reliability of your code. By writing tests that cover different scenarios and functionalities, you can validate the behavior of your code and catch potential bugs early in the development process.

I hope you find this project helpful and informative. Happy testing!
